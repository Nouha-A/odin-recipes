    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe will yield: 1 Half-Sheet Pan; 4½ Dozen Squares, approximately 2 in. (5 cm)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Egg whites (5 whites) 150 g</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar 480 g </li>
        <li>Glucose or corn syrup 120 g</li>
        <li>Water 180 ml</li>
        <li>Sheet gelatin, softened 10 sheets 20 g</li>
        <li>Orange or lemon oil(optional) 10 drops</li>
        <li>10 drops Powdered sugar as neede</li>
        <li>Cornstarch as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a sheet pan with oiled parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. place the egg whites in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the whip attachment.</li>
        <li>Bring the sugar, glucose syrup and water to a boil in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
            once the mixture begins to boil, start to whip the egg whites on low speed.</li>
            <li>While the eggs whip, cook the sugar syrup to 265°f (130°c).</li>
            <li>as soon as the sugar syrup reaches 265°f (130°c), increase the mixer speed to medium-high. pour the syrup over the whipping egg whites, holding the pan close to the inner wall of the bowl to avoid pouring syrup onto the whip.</li>
            <li>as soon as all of the syrup has been added to the whipped egg whites, melt the gelatin and pour it into the whipped egg mixture, avoiding the whip attachment.</li>
            <li>remove the bowl from the mixer. Gently fold in the orange oil, using a whisk or spatula, without deflating the meringue. spread the marshmallow in an even layer onto
                the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Let the marshmallow dry, uncovered, 24 hours at room temperature.</li>
                <li>to portion the marshmallows, sift together equal amounts of powdered sugar and cornstarch.
                    sprinkle the surface of the marshmallow with half of the mixture. invert the pan of marshmallow onto a clean sheet of parchment paper. cut the marshmallow into 2-inch (5-centimeter) squares.
                    toss the cut pieces of marshmallow in the remaining sugar mixture.</li>

    </ol>
